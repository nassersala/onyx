Hi, Thanks for downloading the Onyx Gallery!

To install this application, please follow the following steps:

1. Download it! Which I assume you've already done....

2. Configure your database(s) in config/database.yml
   * Note: Onyx requires a database to store image information in. 
           Most ruby on rails applications use a database to store 
           information. By default, Onyx uses Mysql.

3. Run 'rake db:migrate' from the command line(typically using ssh).

4. That's it! Visit your application using fastcgi/mongrel/webrick.

* Note: If you need any additional help, see the README section, it 
tells you everything you need to get started, or contact us, 
post in our forum, etc.
